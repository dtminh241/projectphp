            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;KEANSBURG, N.J.&lt;/b&gt; — One milestone birthday to celebrate as Keansburg Amusement Park opens in full
                this weekend: Its kiddie “pedal” cars turn 80.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The seven vintage cars, painted yellow and green, have been carrying children around and around since the
                1930s.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;“It’s one of a kind, really,” marketing director Katie Johnson said. “They used to have pedals inside and
                you would ride them on the street. Someone created a ride out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ride is the oldest in the park, which was founded in 1904.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;main-body-inside&quot;&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;main-body-left&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;“It’s essentially been the same for 80 years,” Johnson said. “Their bodies are steel, which these
                        days is unheard of. At one point they had little whistles and horns.”&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The cars took a beating at the hands of superstorm Sandy in 2012. Seven of the eight survived.
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The eighth was “flat as a pancake,” Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;“We actually still have it,” she said. “The rest we sent to a shop in Middletown. They
                        hand-hammered out each car and painted them.”&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Keansburg Amusement Park is known for its historic features, in a place built up from marshland
                        in a time when no one gave a second thought to draining the swamps.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The kids’ airplane ride also dates back to the 1930s. But the pedal cars stand out because of
                        their unmistakably classic design.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;“One of the wonderful things about that particular ride and other historical rides — we get a lot
                        of grandparents and great aunts and uncles, generations of people who have been on that ride,”
                        Johnson said. “They’ll say, ‘I rode that ride in the &#039;40s.’ It’s wonderful when we get people
                        who marvel at that fact and it brings back memories of them riding it.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Three years ago this fall, a now infamous storm came calling.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It blew across our beaches, ripped apart our hometowns and then retreated, taking with it much of what we love about life at the Shore.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, we got a piece of that old life back.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;image-note&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://keansburgamusementpark.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/olde-heidelberg-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Allison Gehlhaus and her husband, Hank, hold a photo of Old Heidelberg Inn, a hot dog spot that opened in the 1930s and was destroyed by superstorm Sandy in 2012. Hank and his brother, Bill, reopened the famed hot dog spot at Keansburg Amusement Park earlier this month. THOMAS P. COSTELLO/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER &lt;span&gt;(Photo: THOMAS P. COSTELLO/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Brothers Hank and Bill Gehlhaus, who own the superstorm Sandy-ravaged Keansburg Amusement Park, reopened Olde Heidelberg Aug. 8. The park’s iconic hot dog restaurant, which dates back to the 1930s, had been flooded and destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“When people come in, their jaws drop open,” said Hank Gehlhaus, who is 58 and has “worked here my whole life. They say, ‘It’s the Heidelberg, but even more beautiful than I remember it.’”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A long way back&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The Heidelberg, as Gehlhaus calls it, opened in 1934, when hot dogs could be purchased for a nickel. The brothers, whose family owned the amusement park from 1904 through the ’70s and who bought the park back in 1995, took over the operation of Olde Heidelberg following the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“The Heidelberg was right at ground zero of the damage,” said Hank Gehlhaus, who lives in Rumson. His brother, Bill, is 62 and lives in Atlantic Highlands. “There was more of the water here than anywhere else; it took a direct hit.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;image-note&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://keansburgamusementpark.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/olde-heidelberg-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“When we got to it, the only thing we could save were the original tables, beautiful wooden tables with marble tops,” he said. “Everything else was ruined in the storm; we had to come in and redo everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The restoration took a year, but the pride in Gehlhaus’ voice when he talks about the Heidleberg makes it clear: Their hard work was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“This is such a key part of the amusement park, a key part of the Bayshore,” he said. “We realized it was such an icon, and that this deserves a special bit of attention. We said let’s take our time, let’s make the place look like a palace.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;“Everything is brand new and meticulously installed to mirror the original Heidelberg,” Gehlhaus said. “I want it to last. I want this place to be timeless. I want my kids to come here, want their kids to come here. I want to make this for the ages.”&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;main-body-right&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take a bite&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;The Heidelberg was famous for its griddle franks and draft beer, “that was its claim to fame through the generations,” Gehlhaus said.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;When it came time to rebuild, he was determined to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;“We had to search for months to find just the right blend of pork and beef and just the right amount of crunch,” Gehlhaus said, adding that he tastes a hot dog every day to make sure the flavor is consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;div class=&quot;main-body-inside&quot;&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;You can have your Heidelberg dog topped with sweet or hot relish, spicy mustard, sauerkraut, homemade chili or caramelized onions, which Gehlhaus’ wife, Allison, cooks all morning in a mix of wine and sugar. A hot dog costs $2.95; the relishes, sauerkraut and condiments are complimentary and the addition of onions or chili costs 50 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;And don’t forget a cold beer from the full bar to wash it all down.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;“People are so happy. Everybody has a smile on their face, the kids are&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;main-body-end&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;main-body-end-left&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;drinking root beer and birch beer,” Gehlhaus said. “People are coming in and they are being wheeled in by their children, they are in their 70s, their 80s, their 90s and they’re coming in to relive the Heidleberg experience from when they were a child.&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;“It’s been so gratifying,” he said. “It’s so nice to bring something back that people thought was gone forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;main-body-end-right&quot;&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Boardwalk &amp; Dining&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Time for lunch: If you&#039;re looking for something a little different, head to Shish Kabob Gourmet for shish kabobs and corn on the cob, both of which are grilled to order. There&#039;s also Cheesy&#039;s Pizza and Dylan&#039;s Walk-in Tacos and Hot Dogs; at the latter, enjoy a side of Fritos or Doritos mixed with taco seasonings.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Need a snack?: Get to Glenda&#039;s Great Fries for a boardwalk classic — hand-cut french fries served with vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dinner date&lt;/b&gt;: At Miami Club, a sit-down spot, choose between a raw bar, homemade clam chowder, seafood or burgers — or try it all. There&#039;s also The Boardwalk Grill, serving up pulled pork, hamburgers, hot dogs and fries; Barb&#039;s Burritos, which offers traditional Mexican fare, and the newly renovated Olde Heidelberg Inn, a well-known hot dog joint that dates back to the 1930s and is coming back this year after being destroyed by superstorm Sandy.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Keeping cool in Keansburg&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The Bayshore&#039;s version of boardwalk excitement is centered in Keansburg. The venerable Keansburg Amusement Park celebrates its 111th anniversary this year, and is celebrating the occasion on Sept. 1, with $1.11 specials and other promotions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This summer, Keansburg Amusement Park introduces its new rollercoaster, Looping Star, which replaces the Wild Cat coaster that was destroyed by Sandy in October 2012. The Italian-made Pinfari ZL42 rollercoaster has one loop, offering turns, drops and over-the-edge twists.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other thrill rides at Keansburg include the Cliff Hanger, which will make you feel like you can fly.&lt;/p&gt;</column>

            &lt;h2&gt;WHY VISIT:&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;We have people that come from Florida to get the pizza because they grew up here and love our pizza,&quot; said James Carusotto, whose father, Anthony, owns Pizza V. The pizzeria has been on the boardwalk for nearly 50 years. &quot;I was making pizza (on a recent Sunday), two ladies came up and said &#039;I came from Newark for this pizza.&#039; And then last year, a customer told me he comes from Lodi just for our pizza. Lodi borders New York, it is probably a little over an hour away. Then he goes home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;THE PIZZA:&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If you are a pizza purist, Pizza V on the boardwalk is the place for you. They keep things simple: &quot;We only make plain pizza,&quot; Carusotto said, &quot;but if someone brings pepperoni, etc., we will put it on the pizza.&quot; Their tomato sauce is homemade, and their pies are topped with mozzarella cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;WHERE:&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pizza V is at 275 Beachway Ave. on the Keansburg boardwalk; call 732-495-1292&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;KEANSBURG - The Keansburg Amusement Park is set to open this weekend for the 2015 season.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Several new attractions and rides have been restored. Park owner William Gelhaus says it&#039;s a great place to celebrate the nicer weather.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;We&#039;re expecting great things. This is the first weekend after a miserable winter and everyone is trying to get out. So we&#039;re expecting one of our biggest days of the year,&quot; says Gelhaus.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Owners say they expect a new looping coaster to be one of this season&#039;s biggest attractions. Visitors of the park will have to wait until the ride is properly inspected, however.&lt;/p&gt;</column>

            &lt;img src=&quot;https://keansburgamusementpark.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/catepillar-ride.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;a href=&quot;https://cm.app.com/offers-reg/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.app.com%2Fstory%2Fentertainment%2Fevents%2F2014%2F08%2F20%2Ffounded-keansburg-amusement-park-still-charms%2F14343591%2F&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Asbury Park Press&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 1904, William Gehlhaus convinced five investors to join him in purchasing an area of marshland overlooking Raritan Bay, in hopes of creating a resort area.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It was a bold move, especially because Gehlhaus was a baker from Atlantic Highlands, with no experience in real estate development.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Gehlhaus and his partners founded the New Point Comfort Beach Company and set about filling in the marsh with sand from the bay. The company quickly went beyond plans for a boardwalk and vacation bungalows, adding a water company and two banks.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 1909, Gehlhaus founded the Keansburg Steamboat Company to bring visitors across the bay from New York City. He built a dance hall and the New Point Hotel and added amusements, including a Ferris wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The earliest rides are gone, and the wooden boardwalk was replaced with a paved walkway after a hurricane in 1944. The steamboat ferries stopped running after another hurricane destroyed the pier in 1960. But Keansburg Amusement Park still operates some of the same kiddie rides it debuted in the 1920s and &#039;30s, painstakingly restored and maintained, with many others dating from the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#039;s no secret that grandparents come here every day to show their grandchildren what rides they rode when they were kids,&quot; said Hank Gehlhaus, grandson of founder William. &quot;It&#039;s very, very important to us that that legacy continues.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The borough of Keansburg, which was incorporated in 1917, basically grew up around William Gehlhaus&#039; vision of summertime fun. And 110 years later, Keansburg, &quot;the gem of the Bayshore,&quot; is still best known for its namesake amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;The kids are having a good time, and it&#039;s close to home,&#039;&#039; said Josephine Prestia of Matawan on a recent crystalline afternoon at the park. &quot;It&#039;s great when you have some last-minute free time, because we can get here fast and have fun.&#039;&#039;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prestia brought her children, Gabriella, 9, and Robert, 7, to the kiddie rides, where they enjoyed the Super Slide and the Happy Swing. Robert wore a sign around his neck that read, &quot;I won my goldfish tank today,&quot; referring to the prize he won at one of Keansburg&#039;s games of chance.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;They&#039;ll hold the fish for him until we&#039;re done with the rides, and that&#039;s like his receipt,&quot; Prestia said. &quot;It&#039;s so cute – they do a lot of nice things like that here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On Aug. 28, Keansburg Amusement Park will celebrate its 110th anniversary with price specials of $1.10 on certain concession foods, games and other attractions. There also will be a pancake-eating contest, sponsored by IHOP.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;My grandfather really filled in a good part of Keansburg,&quot; said Hank Gehlhaus, who now owns the park with his brother, also named William. &quot;It was all marshland. He created half the town.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hank Gehlhaus has been running Keansburg Amusement Park with William and their respective families for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Their father, Henry Gehlhaus, had sold the family business in 1972, due to health concerns that turned out to be premature.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hank kept a foot in the door, so to speak, by running concession stands at the park. When he saw his chance to re-claim the park, he jumped at it.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;We were heartbroken when my dad sold it,&quot; Hank said. &quot;I was only 12 and William was 16. But my dad thought he was doing the right thing – he wanted us all provided for, and he wanted everything settled. He was getting migraines, and he had gotten it into his head that he had a brain tumor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hank can now relate to the pressure his father must have felt.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;The first year I ran the park, I got a kidney stone,&quot; Hank said. &quot;There was definitely a learning curve for me. It took me two or three seasons to get on my feet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The current Gehlhaus generation is responsible for one of the biggest expansions to the park, with the addition of Runaway Rapids in 1996, one of the first water parks in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;Even with the cool summer we&#039;ve had,&quot; Hank said, &quot;Runaway Rapids has remained very popular.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More recently, the Gehlhaus family contended with superstorm Sandy, which destroyed the Wildcat rollercoaster and severely flooded and damaged many other parts of the park in October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The vintage kiddie rides came apart and were scattered beyond Keansburg, but the amusement park eventually recovered and restored every piece.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A new rollercoaster, the Looping Star, has been built to replace the Wildcat, pending state inspections.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Neither hurricanes nor recessions can keep this place down for long. In addition to its vintage kiddie rides, Keansburg Amusement Park is known for its affordability and its friendly staff, with employees in their teens as well as in their late 70s. Pull into the sandy parking lot by the batting cages and you will be greeted warmly by the attendant. Plus, it only will set you back $5 to park there, all day.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;We want to make it affordable for everyone,&#039;&#039; Hank said. &quot;We want families to be able to come back again and again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As a child, Hank Gehlhaus was well accustomed to the razzle-dazzle of his family&#039;s business, because he tagged along with his father during the work day.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;I never lost sight of it, how magical it was,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amusement park changed little from the 1930s to &#039;50s, Hank said, but subsequent decades brought demand for continuous novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#039;s a measure of our fast-paced society that everybody always wants to see something new,&quot; Hank said. &quot;We really prefer the old stuff, but we always mix it up so there is something new for people, however small it might be. Like, my wife found these cotton-candy cones that are LED-driven, so that when you buy cotton candy at night, you walk around the park and it looks like you&#039;re eating something that&#039;s lit up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One thing Hank expects to remain constant is his family&#039;s connection to Keansburg Amusement Park.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;I have five children,&quot; he said, &quot;and they&#039;re eager to take it over when I&#039;m ready to step down.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</column>

            &lt;p&gt;KEANSBURG - Construction has begun on a new ride at Keansburg Amusement Park to replace the &quot;Wild Cat&quot; coaster mangled by the superstorm.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The foundation is down for the new roller coaster, and parts of it have also arrived. It will have a loop taking passengers upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;Keansburg was known for the roller coaster amongst a couple of other major attractions,&quot; says Katie Johnson, of Keansburg Amusement Park. &quot;And I think that this particular roller coaster is going to bring back the new blood.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Right now the sign on it reads &quot;Looping Star,&quot; but a spokesperson says the amusement park will have an online contest to come up with an original name.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The roller coaster is scheduled for completion by &lt;b&gt;March 1&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</column>

            &lt;img src=&quot;https://keansburgamusementpark.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/keansburg-easter.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href=&quot;https://patch.com/new-jersey/middletown-nj/keansburg-amusement-parks-opens-season-april-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;New Jersey 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pattie Cappuccio never doubted it.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Not even the day after the storm, when her game booths at Keansburg Amusement Park were covered in knee-deep sand, left behind by chest-high flood waters.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;I knew Bill and Hank (Gehlhaus) would get us open. I really did,&quot; she said, as she opened the family-run concession for their 26th season. &quot;I knew their crew would get us ready.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So there she was last weekend, with colorful, stuffed dolls pegged to walls and hanging overhead; prizes for a game where over-sized basketballs and undersized hoops make winning harder than it looks, easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Same goes for the park’s opening.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the days following Hurricane Sandy, the Gehlhaus brothers promised their park would open by Easter, just like every year.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This promise was made while their rides were broken and scattered around town, carried off by the Raritan Bay waves that the flattened dunes and severely damaged every arcade building and food stand at the park.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;One of the bumper cars — the green one — was in my parking spot,&quot; said C.C. Wereta, who lives in a condo a block away, as she walked the midway Sunday. Worse, a funhouse mannequin floated into her garage. &quot;I thought it was somebody who drowned.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The only drowning, though, would be in work. Five months of nothing but eat, work and sleep, has drained them.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah, we’re tired,&quot; said Hank Gehlhaus, whose eyes show the weariness. &quot;And it’as been tough. We just got our electricity back last week, because JCP&amp;L ran out of meters. But we’re back, and we want to show people we’re better than we were.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The grand opening is this weekend, and Hank Gehlhaus said the park will be about &quot;70 percent&quot; ready.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;(Last) weekend was a soft opening,&quot; said Bill Gehlhaus. &quot;We wanted people to see how far we’ve come and we’re selling our 2-for-1 discount tickets for the season.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So while a couple of kiddie rides went ‘round and ‘round at one end of the park, and go-karts raced at the other, electricians and plumbers and carpenters nearly outnumbered visitors along the macadam midway.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of those plumbers was Stan Ambro, who is also the owner of &quot;Hollowgraves,&quot; a haunted mansion that was on Seaside’s Funtown Pier. The house is now on three trailers on a Keansburg Amusement Park back lot, and Ambro hopes to have it erected and reopened soon.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m glad to be back home,&quot; said Ambro, who started at Keansburg in 2002. &quot;The Gehlhauses are showmen. They understand the business.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The park has been in the Gehlhaus family for over 100 years, except for a 23-year span when it was sold by the brothers’ father. They bought it back in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;This is what we do,&quot; Bill Gehlhaus said days after the storm. &quot;We’re not going anywhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;But they will continue now without two star attractions. The Wildcat roller coaster, the ride closest to the bay, was buried and bent by sand. Hank Gehlhaus said it would have cost $500,000 to restore, and &quot;we just didn’t think it was worth it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The vintage bumper cars were another casualty.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;That hurts, from an emotional standpoint,&quot; Hank Gehlhaus said. &quot;They were in service in this park for 50 years. It’s a shame.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wildcat will be replaced by a newer, looping coaster from Canada; new bumper cars are coming from the Italian ridemaker Bertazzon.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;We also have a new swing ride, from a park in Alabama,&quot; Hank Gehlhaus said.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The heart of the park — the old-school kiddie rides — remain intact. All the engines and electrical circuits were rebuilt, and last weekend, the fire engines and sky rockets were doing their usual laps, with children clutching steering wheels while parents smiled and took pictures from outside the gates.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joe Schmidt was there with his daughter, Julia, 5, making her memories while reliving his own.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;We came here at least once a week, when I was a kid,&quot; said Schmidt, an elementary school principal. &quot;When I think of all I got out of this place, I wanted to come down and support them. I’m glad they rebuilt it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</column>

            &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KEANSBURG — Just days after getting battered by Hurricane Sandy, the co-owner of the Keansburg Amusement Park and Runaway Rapids Waterpark has already set a reopening date: April 8, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That gives the Gehlhaus Family and its crew five months five months to clear out several feet of sand caked inside the roller coasters and other rides damaged by the estimated 6-foot wall of water that pummeled the 108-year-old amusement park.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 300,000 people visit the water park, amusement park and concession stands every year. &quot;The clock is ticking and we&#039;ll be ready for them,&quot; Gehlhaus said with enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gehlhaus said he and his brother have invested $4 million into the family business over the last 17 years, adding the water park and 30 rides, so they could one day turn it over to the next generation to run.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rebuilding &quot;will be a challenge,&quot; but one he would &quot;attack with a lot of energy,&quot; and help from a crew of about 25 so far.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;They&#039;ve already gotten off to a good start. In the past two days, he and his crew have found portions of fence, machinery and pieces of disassembled rides that were stored away for the season.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;We&#039;ve retrieved almost everything,&quot; some of it a half-mile inland on people&#039;s yards or alleyways, he said. &quot;Most everything will be cleaned and rehabilitated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Albert Marine Construction in Waretown also wasted no time in beginning work on restoring Keansburg shoreline.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Just last week, the company had trucked in dredged sand to make 20-25-foot dunes. Sandy washed away all of their work. Two foremen on bulldozers returned Thursday to start over.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;There was three feet of sand inside the rides,&quot; said Nick Hauser, one of the foremen. &quot;They got banged up here really bad.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</column>
