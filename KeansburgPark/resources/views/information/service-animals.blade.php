    <p><b>Service Animals</b></p>
    <p>Trained service animals are welcome at the Keansburg Amusement Park & Runaway Rapids.</p>
    <p>Service animals are defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take a prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties. Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person’s disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals. Miniature horses that have been individually trained to do or perform tasks for people with disabilities will qualify as service animals.</p>
    <p>Emotional support animals, comfort animals, and therapy dogs are not service animals. Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, are not considered service animals. While emotional support animals or comfort animals are often used as part of a medical treatment plan as therapy animals, they are not considered service animals. These support animals provide companionship, relieve loneliness, and sometimes help with depression, anxiety, and certain phobias, but do not have special training to perform tasks that assist people with disabilities.</p>
    <p>The handler is responsible for the control, care, supervision and behavior of the animal. The animal shall always be under the control of its handler. The animal shall have a harness, leash, or other tether, unless either the handler is unable because of a disability to use a harness, leash, or other tether with the service animal, or the use of a harness, leash, or other tether would interfere with the service animal’s safe, effective performance of work or tasks, in which case the service animal must be otherwise under the handler’s control (e.g., voice control, signals, or other effective means). An animal that behaves in an unsafe, uncontrolled or unacceptable way is not permitted on the premises. Examples of unacceptable behavior include uncontrolled barking, jumping on other people, or running away from the handler. An animal that poses a direct risk or threat to the health or safety of others is not permitted on the premises. The animal must be healthy and vaccinated in accordance with applicable laws. The animal must be housebroken.</p>
    <p>We may ask for the removal from the premises of an animal that is not housebroken, or that is out of control, or whose handler does not take effective action to control it, or that behaves in an unsafe, uncontrolled or unacceptable way, or that is not healthy and vaccinated in accordance with applicable laws, or that poses a direct risk or threat to the health or safety of others.</p>
    <p>Animals are not permitted on rides or in the water attractions. Our rides are not equipped or designed for accessibility to or safe ridership or use by animals. While a handler rides a ride or is in a water attraction, or is otherwise not available for the control, care, supervision and behavior of the animal, they must have another member of the handler’s party assume control, care, supervision and behavior of the animal.</p>
    <p>A Service Animal “Relief Areas” are located outside the park in the grassy areas. Owners are responsible for disposing of their animal’s waste.</p>
