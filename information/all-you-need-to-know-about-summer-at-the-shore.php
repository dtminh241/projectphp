            <h2>Boardwalk & Dining</h2>
            <p>Time for lunch: If you're looking for something a little different, head to Shish Kabob Gourmet for shish kabobs and corn on the cob, both of which are grilled to order. There's also Cheesy's Pizza and Dylan's Walk-in Tacos and Hot Dogs; at the latter, enjoy a side of Fritos or Doritos mixed with taco seasonings.</p>
