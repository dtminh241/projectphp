                <p>Runaway Rapids is a family-friendly, participatory waterpark with physically demanding
                    activities. It is our Guest’s responsibility to know and understand their own physical

                    are “non-athletic” in nature or overweight for your body type, we urge you to use caution when
                    choosing which activities, you choose to participate in at the waterpark.</p>
                <p class="gist">CAN YOU PARTICIPATE WITH A CAST, OR A BRACE, OR WHILE PREGNANT?</p>
                <p>For your safety, riders with casts, braces or splints of any kind, recent surgery, back injuries
                    or who are pregnant are NOT permitted on rides at Runaway Rapids Waterpark.</p>
                <p class="gist">ARE THERE HEIGHT AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS?</p>
                <p>All Guests must obey all height and safety restrictions posted at each attraction. All height and
                    safety requirements are set by the park, attractions manufacturer, and state New Jersey.
                    Additionally, all guests who participate must have full body control, ability to climb all
                    stairs to slides without assistance and ability to hold themselves in the position required to

                <p class="gist">DO YOU PROVIDE LIFE JACKETS?</p>
                <p>Only you know your swimming ability, and that of your children and anyone you are supervising. We
                    strongly recommend all guests under 48” who are weak swimmers or non-swimmers wear a U.S. Coast
                    Guard-approved life jacket. We offer FREE of charge life jackets throughout Runaway Rapids
                    Waterpark.</p>
                <p class="gist">WHAT IS THE DRESS CODE?</p>
                <p>Bathing suits are required for all water attractions in the water park. There are two reasons why
                    proper bathing attire is necessary at Runaway Rapids Waterpark:
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Safety</b> – bathing suits are lightweight and are made to not absorb a lot of water,
                        making it
                        much easier for a person to swim. If a person is wearing clothes other than a bathing suit,
                        it can hamper the rescue and endanger the life of the individual or lifeguard.</li>
                    <li><b>Hygiene</b> – typically bathing suits are only worn to swim in and not for other
                        activities.
                        Street clothing or other clothing such as underclothes can introduce bacteria into the
                        water. Street clothing can also introduce much more detergent and dirt as well as dyes into
                        the water which can also make it unsafe for people to swim in.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Appropriate swimwear means suits designed specifically for swimming, made of synthetic materials
                    such as polyester, nylon, and Lycra or spandex. Below is a list of clothing that is NOT
                    considered “Appropriate Swimwear”:
                <ul>
                    <li>Workout Shorts</li>
                    <li>T-Shirts</li>
                    <li>Pants of all kinds including sweatpants and jeans (including cut off shorts)</li>
                    <li>Cover Ups</li>
                    <li>Sports Bras</li>
                    <li>All other clothing that is not specifically made for swimming</li>
                </ul>
